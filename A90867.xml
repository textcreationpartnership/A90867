            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Barbarous Cruelty againſt the

4 Drakes, and 2 Sakers; where after two houres
fight (being twice beaten off by the Townſmen,
in all but 140 Muſqueteers) he entered, put divers to
the Sword, and burnt about 80 Houſes to aſhes,
ſuffering no man to carry away his goods, or quench the
fire, and making no difference between friend or foe;

which I beléeve you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

you of the truth as néere as I

not have aſſaulted us, but in regard they had béen in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of cutting off by the way, in caſe they had béen ſent, I
muſt excuſe them, though it be to our owne ſuffering. We
with the Captaines were ſenſible, that if the Cavaliers
came, we were not likely to withſtand them, they being
néere 1500. and we not above 150. Muſketiers, with a
Troope of Horſe of Captaine <hi>Greaves,</hi> which did no good,
but in their flight, as hereafter you will heare; but in regard
the generall deſire of the Towne, eſpecially of thoſe that
bore Armes, would have them ſtand it out, and not march
away with their Armes, as we might in time, and that
both they, and the malignant would have reviled, and
curſt the Captaines and Majeſtrates of the Towne if,
they had left them, made the Captaines and better ſort
content to ſtay and trie the iſſue, rather then be ſo perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
reproacht: And though the ſame fall hard on one
ſide in looſing the Towne and ſome Armes, and about
80. Houſes burnt to aſhes, with all that therein was, and
<pb facs="tcp:111699:3"/>
ſome fiftéene men, and two women loſt their lives; yet
their gaine was nothing at all, yea, they count it great
loſſe, and curſe the tune that ever they medled with us, for
I believe they loſt as many ordinary men as we, beſides
thrée men of great quality, which they much lament,
whereof two of them were Lords, as we have great
cauſe to thinke, the one the Earle of <hi>Denby</hi> thats ſure, the
other Lord we ſomething doubt of his name, but we heare
by divers of the Cavaliers it is <hi>Digby,</hi> ſure we are he is
wounded; and it is as ſure that ſome of their Collonels
ſay it was a man of greater ranke, and more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
then <hi>Denby;</hi> the other a chiefe Commander: <hi>Denby</hi>
purſued Captaine <hi>Greaves</hi> Troope ſome two miles out
of Towne being at their héeles, before our Troope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
among whom I went away, and Captaine
<hi>Greaves</hi> obſerving his tune betwixt two woods faced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and charged the purſuers moſt valiantly, as they
themſelves confeſſe, and drove them backe againe: in
which charge <hi>Denby</hi> was ſlaine immediately, and the reſt
fled, and ſo we eſcaped with ſafety, onely Captaine <hi>Greaves</hi>
twelved one ſhot in the face, and a cut in the Arme, but
not mortall; in the purſuit of that Troope God made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
for all our Souldiers, ſaving ſome two or thrée, to
eſcape moſt with their Armes, which they threw away
and hid in Pits and Ditches as they could, whereof the
moſt, I thinke, the Cavaléeres found not, and not one
Captaine or Officer was hurt or taken priſoner, nor any
conſiderable man, but moſt poore fellowes, and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,

of our ſide were moſt poore malignants, ſome thrée young

Match, with Powder, and other combuſtible matter at the
other end, which fired in divers places, and divers was
found out and prevented, ſo that we may truely ſay, that

               </gap>ledgers, but eſpecially the priſon, made
a difference betwixt thoſe that feared God, and thoſe that
feare him not. But this is remarkable in their vileneſſe, that
all theſe Houſes ſaving two were fired in their cold blood, at
their departure, wherein they endeavoured to fire all, and
in the flames they would not ſuffer the people to carry out
their good, or to quench it, triumphingly with reproaches
rejoyeth that the Wind flood right to conſume the Towne,
at which preſent the Lord cauſed the Winds to turn, which
was a token of his notice of their inſultation. For pillage
I heare but of little I loſt, having obſcured the things
I had of any valew; and for fire, God did marveliouſly
prevent, both to me and many others, whereat the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants

Mill, and pretend that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> ſo commanded, and
threaten to pull downe my Houſe and divers others, which
I thinke they dare not, left they build it up againe, the
County having ſent them admonition of their inſolency.
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with <hi>Haſting,</hi> kept their Readervow this

this did ſo much enrage them, that they appeared more like Devills
